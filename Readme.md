# Kaggle - Forecasting the optimal number of agents for a Contact Center: Facebook Prophet, InfluxDB Holt-Winter

This project was built and is maintained by Tiago Oliveira - [ti.olive@gmail.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoliveira/).

This work was made based on the [Kaggle Days Meetup Porto 2019 - Forecasting the optimal number of agents for a Contact Center](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdm-porto-2019/)

Even I couldn't finish the Kaglle challenge on time, I took the opportunity to continue the explorations over some Forecasting (multivariate & univariate) libraries and methods. So I could learn a little bit more about time-series data strcuture and Forecasting techiniques as well.

I used [Facebook Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/) for hour forecasting and I loaded the dataset into an InfluxDB instance to extract some meaning with [Holt-Winter](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/how-to-use-influxdbs-holt-winters-function-for-predictions/) method.

Kaggle late submission Score: 29.65850 with Facebook Prophet. The winner has achieved the score 8.69781.

I intend to continue my explorations testing different libraries and methods: ARIMA in Python, Spark/PySpark + MLlib, Tensorflow/Keras.
